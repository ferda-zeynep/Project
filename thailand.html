        <h3>To Cook Thai Marinated Steak</h3>
        <p>
          To make the marinade, pound the black pepper in a mortar and pestle
          into a powder, then add the garlic and pound into a fine paste. Add
          all remaining marinade ingredients and stir to mix well. ½ teaspoon
          black peppercorns,2 cloves garlic,2 tablespoon soy sauce,1 ½
          tablespoon oyster sauce,2 teaspoon sugar,1 tablespoon lime juice,2
          tablespoon neutral oil Place the steaks into a dish just big enough to
          hold them in one layer, or put them in a freezer bag. Add the marinade
          and move the steaks around to ensure they're thoroughly coated. 1.5 lb
          steaks Marinate the steaks for a minimum of 3 hours and up to
          overnight. Bring the steaks out 1 hour before grilling so they will
          not be too cold and will cook more evenly. Note: Marinated steaks,
          especially ones with sugar like this, are better suited for the grill.

        <h3>To Cook Pad Thai</h3>
        <p>
          Soak rice noodles in warm water for about 30 minutes or until
          softened. Drain well. In a wok or large skillet, heat some oil over
          medium-high heat. Add minced garlic and stir-fry until fragrant. Add
          shrimp or tofu pieces and cook until shrimp turns pink or tofu is
          slightly browned. Push the protein to one side of the pan and pour
          beaten eggs onto the other side. Scramble the eggs until cooked. Add
          the drained noodles to the pan along with tamarind paste, fish sauce,
          and palm sugar. Stir well to combine. Toss in bean sprouts and
          continue to stir-fry for a few more minutes until everything is heated
          through. Serve hot, garnished with crushed peanuts, lime wedges, and
          any optional toppings you prefer.

        <h3>To Cook Mango Sticky Rice</h3>
        <p>
          Rinse the glutinous rice under cold water until the water runs clear.
          Soak the rice in water for at least 4 hours or preferably overnight.
          After soaking, drain the rice and steam it in a bamboo steamer or a
          steaming basket lined with cheesecloth or muslin cloth for about 20-25
          minutes, or until the rice is tender and cooked through. While the
          rice is steaming, prepare the coconut sauce. In a small saucepan,
          combine coconut milk, sugar, and a pinch of salt. Heat the mixture
          over low heat, stirring constantly, until the sugar is dissolved.
          Remove from heat and let it cool slightly.

        <h3>To Make Coconut Ice Cream</h3>
        <p>
          In a saucepan, combine coconut milk, sugar, and a pinch of salt. Heat
          over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar is fully
          dissolved. Remove the saucepan from heat and stir in vanilla extract.
          Let the mixture cool completely. Once cooled, transfer the mixture
          into an ice cream maker and churn according to the manufacturer's
          instructions until it reaches a soft-serve consistency. Transfer the
          churned ice cream into a container and freeze for a few hours until
          firm. Serve scoops of coconut ice cream in bowls or cones, and enjoy
          the creamy, coconutty goodness!
