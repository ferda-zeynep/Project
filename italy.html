        <h3>To Make Caprese Salad</h3>
        <p>
          Arrange the Salad: On a serving platter or individual plates,
          alternate slices of tomatoes and mozzarella cheese, slightly
          overlapping them. Add Basil Leaves: Tuck fresh basil leaves between
          the tomato and mozzarella slices. You can use whole leaves or tear

          the salad, ensuring each slice is lightly coated. Optionally, drizzle
          some balsamic vinegar over the salad for added flavor. Season with
          Salt and Pepper: Sprinkle salt and freshly ground black pepper over
          the salad to taste. Remember that the cheese can be slightly salty, so  adjust the seasoning accordingly. Serve: Serve the Caprese Salad
          immediately, allowing the flavors to meld together at room
          temperature.</p>
