        <h3>To Cook Jollof Rice</h3>
        <p>
          Cook the onions in the olive oil in a large pot until softened. Then
          add the garlic and ginger and cook for 30 seconds to release their
          fragrance. Stir frequently so they don’t burn! Add the rice and stir
          it in the pot to toast it. Add the stock, crushed tomatoes, seasoned
          salt, smoked paprika, curry powder, thyme, paprika, and bay leaf to
          the pot. Stir everything together and once it boils, cover it with a
          lid and cook until the liquid evaporates and the rice is tender. Turn
          off the heat and allow the rice to rest with the lid on. Remove the
          bay leaf and stir everything together. Serve it up garnished with
          parsley and bay leaves.

        <h3>To Cook Puff Puff</h3>
        <p>
          In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, yeast, and salt.
          Gradually add the warm water to the dry ingredients, stirring
          continuously until a smooth, thick batter forms. The consistency
          should be similar to that of pancake batter. Cover the bowl with
          plastic wrap or a clean kitchen towel and let the batter rest in a
          warm place for about 1 hour, allowing it to rise and double in size.
          In a deep pot or fryer, heat vegetable oil to 350°F (175°C) over
          medium-high heat. Using a spoon or your hands, scoop up a small
          portion of the batter and carefully drop it into the hot oil. Repeat
          with more batter, making sure not to overcrowd the pot. Fry the puff
          puff until golden brown on all sides, turning occasionally to ensure
          even cooking. This usually takes about 3-5 minutes. Remove the fried
          puff puff from the oil using a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels
          to remove excess oil.

        <h3>To cook Egusi soup</h3>
        <p>
          Soak 1 cup of egusi seeds in water for about 5 minutes. Drain and
          blend until smooth. Set aside. In a large pot, heat 2 tablespoons of
          palm oil over medium heat. Sauté 1 chopped onion until translucent.
          Add 2 chopped tomatoes to the pot and cook until softened. Stir in the
          blended egusi and 2 tablespoons of ground crayfish. Cook, stirring
          constantly, for 5-7 minutes. Add 500g of assorted meat to the pot and
          cook until browned. Pour in 2 cups of vegetable or chicken broth.
          Season with salt and pepper to taste. Cover and cook for 20-25
          minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in 2 cups of chopped spinach or
          bitter leaf and cook for an additional 5 minutes.
