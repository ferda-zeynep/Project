        <h3>To cook Teriyaki chicken</h3>
        <p>
          Butterfly chicken thigh fillets to make the fillet an even thickness.
          Using the tip of a knife, poke the skin randomly. Heat a frying pan

          further. Add the Teriyaki Sauce to the pan and cook until the sauce
          thickens. Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and cover with a
          sheet of foil. Cut the chicken into bite-sized strips.

        <h3>To Make Sushi</h3>
        <p>
          Cook sushi rice according to package instructions and let it cool
          slightly. Place a sheet of nori on a bamboo sushi mat. Spread a thin
          layer of sushi rice over the nori, leaving a 1-inch border at the top.
          Arrange avocado slices, cucumber strips, and crab sticks in the center
          of the rice. Carefully roll the sushi using the bamboo mat, applying
          gentle pressure to shape it into a cylinder. Wet the top border of the
          nori with a little water to seal the roll. Slice the roll into
          bite-sized pieces using a sharp knife. Sprinkle toasted sesame seeds
          over the California rolls. Serve with soy sauce, wasabi, and pickled
          ginger. Enjoy your homemade California Rolls!

        <h3>To cook Okonomiyaki(Japanese pancake)</h3>
        <p>
          In a large bowl, whisk together all-purpose flour and dashi until
          smooth. Add shredded cabbage, sliced green onions, chopped shrimp,
          chopped bacon, and eggs to the batter. Mix until well combined. Heat a
          non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat and lightly oil the
          surface. Pour the batter onto the skillet to form a pancake about 1/2
          inch thick. Cook for 4-5 minutes on each side until golden brown and
          cooked through. Transfer the cooked okonomiyaki to a plate and drizzle
          with okonomiyaki sauce and mayonnaise. Sprinkle bonito flakes and
          dried seaweed flakes on top. Serve hot and enjoy your Osaka-style
          Okonomiyaki!
