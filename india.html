        <p>
          Wash and soak basmati rice for 30 minutes, then drain. In a saucepan,

          minutes). Sweeten with sugar, add cardamom powder, and saffron strands
          if using. Stir in chopped nuts and simmer for a few more minutes.
          Serve warm or chilled, garnished with raisins and additional nuts if
          desired.
