        <h3>To Cook Crêpes</h3>
        <p>
          In a mixing bowl, whisk together flour and eggs. Gradually whisk in
          milk and water until smooth. Stir in melted butter and a pinch of
          salt. Heat a lightly greased skillet over medium heat. Pour a small
          amount of batter into the skillet and swirl to spread thinly. Cook
          until the edges start to lift and the bottom is golden brown, then
          flip and cook the other side. Repeat with the remaining batter,
          stacking the cooked crêpes on a plate. Serve warm with your favorite
          toppings such as Nutella, jam, fresh fruit, or whipped cream. Enjoy
          your delicious homemade crêpes

        <h3>To cook boeuf bourguignon</h3>
        <p>
          Toss together beef pieces, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl; set
          aside. Cook bacon in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat until fat is
          rendered and bacon is beginning to brown, 7 to 8 minutes. Add seasoned
          beef to bacon and cook, stirring often, until well browned, 7 to 8
          minutes. Add onion and cook, stirring often, until beginning to
          soften, 2 to 3 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring constantly, for
          1 minute. Add mushrooms and tomato paste to mixture and cook, stirring
          occasionally, for 4 minutes. Stir in broth, wine, and carrots and
          bring mixture to a boil. Reduce heat to low. Cover and cook for 40 to
          45 minutes or until beef is fork-tender. Uncover and remove 1/2 cup
          broth to a 1-cup glass measuring cup. Whisk in flour until completely
