        <h3>To cook Chicken Tacos with avocado salsa verde</h3>
        <p>
          Start by de-husking the tomatillos and giving them a good rinse. I
          usually cut out the stems as well. Roast the tomatillos in the oven
          (400F) for 15 minutes or so. Note: there's leeway on the roasting
          method, feel free to pan roast the tomatillos or use the broiler. Once
          the tomatillos are roasted, add them to a blender or food processor
          along with: 1/2 small onion, 1 peeled garlic clove, 10-12 sprigs
          cilantro, and 1 jalapeno. Combine well. Feel free to start with just
          1/2 or 1/4 of the jalapeno for a milder batch. To increase heat simply
          add additional slivers of the jalapeno until it tastes right to you.
          Once you're happy with the heat, add the flesh of a single avocado and
          combine well. You can optionally add a pinch of salt but I usually
          skip it. You are welcome to cook the chicken as you see fit. Basically
          you are just chopping up a chicken breast and combining with: salt,
          pepper, chile powder and a bit of oil. This gets cooked off with a few
          slivers of onion.

        <h3>To cook chicken enchilladas</h3>
        <p>
          Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a baking dish with cooking
          spray. Warm the corn tortillas in the microwave for about 30 seconds
          to make them pliable. Spoon a portion of shredded chicken onto each
          tortilla and roll them up tightly. Place the rolled tortillas
          seam-side down in the greased baking dish. Pour the enchilada sauce
          over the rolled tortillas, making sure they are evenly covered.
          Sprinkle shredded cheese over the top of the enchiladas. Bake in the
          preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and
          bubbly. Garnish with chopped onion and cilantro. Serve hot with sour
          cream and sliced avocado on the side. Enjoy your delicious Chicken
          Enchiladas!

        <h3>To Make Guacamole</h3>
        <p>
          Cut the avocados in half, remove the pits, and scoop the flesh into a
          bowl. Mash the avocado with a fork until smooth or chunky, depending
          on your preference. Stir in chopped onion, cilantro, jalapeño pepper,
          diced tomato, and lime juice. Season with salt and pepper to taste,
          and stir until well combined. Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary.
          Serve the guacamole immediately with tortilla chips for dipping. Enjoy
          your homemade Guacamole!

        <h3>To cook stuffed peppers</h3>
        <p>
          Roast poblano peppers over an open flame or under the broiler until
          charred on all sides. Place them in a plastic bag for 10 minutes, then
          peel off the skins, make a slit, and remove the seeds. In a skillet,
          heat vegetable oil over medium heat. Sauté onion and garlic until
          softened. Add cooked shredded chicken or beef and corn kernels to the
          skillet. Cook until heated through. Stuff each poblano pepper with the
          meat and corn mixture, then top with shredded cheese. Place stuffed
          peppers in a baking dish and pour tomato sauce over them. Bake at
          350°F (175°C) for 20-25 minutes, or until heated through and cheese is
          melted. Garnish with cilantro leaves, sour cream, and avocado slices
          if desired. Serve hot and enjoy your Chiles Rellenos!
